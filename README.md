Javascript Assessment:

What did you like about this project?
It was extremely challenging compared to all the practices we had. It felt like the difficulty level of the task went from 10 to 100. I like that it highlighted the areas I didn't understand (which was almost everything haha). I had to think of different solutions and also question why certain solutions don't work, which makes this project fun. 


What did you struggle with in this project?
Everything! I think if Jean didn't guide us through at the start, I wouldn't know where to begin. 
The main aspect of my struggle would be trying to process all the new concepts on the spot, while trying to solve the problem. 
Sorry I couldn't complete this project.



What would make your experience with this assessment better?
If we had more time to process our learnings and to work on this project over a few days, I think it might help?
It would be great if we can have a walk-through for this project!

Thank you! :)
